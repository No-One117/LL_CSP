# LL 6th Expressions Notes!

# What is an algorithm?
# an algorith is a set of instructions

#List steps in an algorithm
# a collesction of numbers and symbols 
#

# List ALL of the mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
# +
# -
# *
# /
#List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)
#
#Why are expressions so important in programming?
