# LL 6th Conditional

#this is a conditonal! (look for if and else statements)
x = 5
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")



name = input("please tell me your name")

if name == ("goofy"):
    print(f"i must say that is quite goofy Mr {name}")
elif name == ("john"):
    print("hello cheif")
else:
    print(f"hello {name}, nice to meat you")

# What puts something inside of the “if” statement?

# to put something into an if statement you need a conditional expression that has a true or false value.

# What do if statements do?

# if statements check if something is true and prints something because of it (if it is true)

# What are boolean statements? 

# expressions that evaluate to one of two possible values like True or False

# What do else statements do?

# else statements check if the thing you typed in is correct and if it isnt it prints something like please type only letters

# What kind of statement do you use if you have more than 2 needed outcomes?

# elif

# What do each of the different symbols mean in conditionals?
# < less than                               |
# > greater than         <- comparison ops  |   
# <= less than or equal too                 |  
# >= greater than or equal to               | 
# == equal too                              | 
# != not equal too                          | 
# What are the 3 logical operators?
 
# and,or,not
num = 45
if num >=0 and num < 10:
    print(f"{num} is a single diget number")
elif num <25 or num == 50:
    print(f"{num} is a stupid number")

# What are logical operators for?

# to combine and manipulate Boolean expressions

# What does a nested conditional statement do?

# allows a program to evaluate multiple condidtions sequentially
