#LL 6th String Notes.py

# what makes some a string
# a string is a collection of charectors 
#ex "hi loser dum dum" or 'hi loser dum dum'

#examples of strings
name = input ("whats your name")
print(f"Nice to meet you {name}")
sentence = ("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
print(sentence.find("brown"))
print(sentence[10:15])

# why do we have strings?

#how do stupid proofing and sanitization relate to eachother
#users = stupid


#what is debugging
#debugging is is fixing problems in my code!
#a bug is any problem in code that makes code not run or run improperly
#string = "this is an error'
   # syntax error
#print(num_one + num_two)
   # logic error
#letter = 'a'
#int(letter)
   # run-time error

#how do you debug the differant typ of errors
 #find()
 #concanate (ADD)
 # capitilize only first letter

# upper makes all of the letters in an input statement uppercase and lower does it to lowercase

#in programming counting starts at zero
#concatinating = putting strings together
